function searchCell = createSearchCell(partArr, partCell, xRange, yRange, xDim, yDim)
% createSearchCell will create a cell array known as a search cell, which
% will assist in speeding up search times over the reef - i.e. when you
% want to determine whether or not a point lies within a reef

% inputs:
% partArr - a partition array, which contains the coordinates of a number
% of rectangular blocks used for speeding up searches, in the form n x 2 x
% 5, where the n refers to the number of blocks present, the 2 corresponds
% to the x and y coordinates, and the 5 corresponds to the points of
% rectangle, with the origin (bottom left hand corner) twice
% partCell - a cell array, where each cell contains the indices of the
% reefs contained in the corresponding partition in an array (same order as
% partArr)
% xRange - [xMin, xMax] for the extent of the partitions when ALL are
% present - earlier code will remove partitions which hold no reefs but you
% need to consider the original full range so that calculations which make
% use of equal distances will work
% yRange - same as above but for y values

% output:
% searchCell - a cell array which is used to speed up the searching process
% it follows the following structure - each level has 4 entries -
% searchCell{3} tells you the current split direction (i.e. "x" or "y") and
% then searchCell{4} tells you the split value i.e. is pointX >= splitVal -
% if the point in question has an x or y value above this splitVal, the
% search continues down searchCell{1} which simply moves down another
% level, or alternatively searchCell{2} if pointX < splitVal
% searchCell{3} could also have the values "empty" or "partition", which
% means that the point does not lie within any reef, or lies within one of
% the reefs listed in searchCell{4} respectively
% the only exception is the top layer, which also has the entries
% searchCell{5} and {6}, which hold the ranges for x and y values covered
% in the search area respectively, and should a point lie outside these
% values it does not lie within a reef

% make the first call to the search cell, which will then further be
% recursively called
searchCell = createSearchCellLevel(partArr, partCell, "x", xRange, yRange, xDim, yDim);

% initialise the last two elements of the first level
searchCell{5} = xRange;
searchCell{6} = yRange;
