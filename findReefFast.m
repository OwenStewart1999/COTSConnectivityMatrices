% findReefFast will take a point stored in point, and determine if it lies
% within a reef, and if so what the index of that reef is

% inputs:
% point - the point in question in the form [x, y]
% GBRShape - a structure taken from a shape file, where each element is a
% separate reef and contains the border coordinates in the fields X and Y
% partArr - a partition array, which contains the coordinates of a number
% of rectangular blocks used for speeding up searches, in the form n x 2 x
% 5, where the n refers to the number of blocks present, the 2 corresponds
% to the x and y coordinates, and the 5 corresponds to the points of
% rectangle, with the origin (bottom left hand corner) twice
% searchCell - a cell array which is used to speed up the searching process
% and can be created using the createSearchCell() function
% overlap - optional -  specify as "overlap" if the GBRShape is the
% enlarged by 1km version, so algorithm can test if point exists inside
% multiple reef outlines
% GBRShape2 - optional - if "overlap" is specified, then GBRShape should be
% the enlarged shape, and GBRShape2 should be the original shapefile - this
% way if there is an overlap, the original, unenlarged shape file can be
% used to determine which reef the point is closer to
% nearest - optional - if specified as "nearest" then rather than returing
% a 0 if the point does not lie within a reef, it will instead return the
% index of the closest reef

% reefInd - the index for the reef which the point lies in, or 0 otherwise
