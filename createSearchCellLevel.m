% createSearchCellLevel will create a level in the searchCell used for
% optimising searching processes - the search cell itself will be a
% recursive cell array, and as such this function itself will be recursive
% function - the returned searchCellBranch will hold a filled out level of
% the search cell, which will also store any further children/branch levels
% below

% inputs:
% GRBShape - a structure taken from a shape file, where each element is a
% separate reef and contains the border coordinates in the fields X and Y 
% partArr - a partition array, which contains the coordinates of a number
% of rectangular blocks used for speeding up searches, in the form n x 2 x
% 5, where the n refers to the number of blocks present, the 2 corresponds
% to the x and y coordinates, and the 5 corresponds to the points of
% rectangle, with the origin (bottom left hand corner) twice
% partCell - a cell array, where each cell contains the indices of the
% reefs contained in the corresponding partition in an array (same order as
% partArr)
% prevXBounds - before the check at the current level has occured, what
% area have we narrowed down our point to, in the form [minX, maxX]
% currYBounds - same as x above
% prevXDim - the previous dimensions of the partition array (before any
% partitions were removed, i.e. dimensions at initialisation)
% prevYDim - as above but for y

% output:
% searchCellBranch - as described in the function description, the current
% level of the searchCell and all its completed children/branches

% first, determine the current split direction - may need to switch if
% either only has 1 dimension left
